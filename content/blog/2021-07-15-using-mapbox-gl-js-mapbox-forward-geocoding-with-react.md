Iâ€™ve always been a fan of [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Maybe because Iâ€™ve found most developers using it, I think I love it due to its simplicity and ease of set-up. Besides this, Mapbox provides a powerful way to customize your map, and their documentation is pretty great.

In this tutorial, Iâ€™ll be showing you how to use React, React hooks, and Mapbox GL JS to build:

*   interactive map with custom marker
*   forward geocoding in Mapbox

Getting started
===============

First, youâ€™ll need an API access token to configure Mapbox GL JS for routing and geocoding. Go to [mapbox.com](https://www.mapbox.com/), create an account. On your dashboard, create a token. Please note that this tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of React.

**_Setting up our project_**

**Step 1:** On your terminal, run `npx create-react-app mapbox-demo` to create our react project. Once the installation is done, enter your project folder with `cd mapbox-demo`.

**Step 2:** Let us also install the Mapbox GL JS library and Mapbox SDK since weâ€™ll be using it.

`npm install mapbox-gl @mapbox/mapbox-sdk`

**Step 3:** In your **src** folder, create a **components** folder. Inside the folder, youâ€™ve just created, create a **GenerateMap.js** file.

Your project structure should look like this

```
...  
â””â”€â”€ src  
    â”œâ”€â”€ components  
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ GenerateMap.js  
    â”‚  
    â”œâ”€â”€ App.css  
    â”œâ”€â”€ App.js  
...
```

Now letâ€™s start by writing some code ðŸ˜‹

Create the HTML page
====================

Open the `public/index.html` file and paste the following code inside it.

This code creates the structure of the HTML page. Here we have the `div` that contains the `id` that holds the root of the page. We also have the `mapbox-gl.css` link at the `head`tag.

Create the React App
====================

Open the `GenerateMap.js` file. Add the following code into it.

Weâ€™ve decided to import a few things here. The Mapbox SDK provides us with services for working with geocoding. And donâ€™t worry, the `<React.Fragment/>` will be changed later.

Next, let us initialize the map. This code will run immediately after the page mounts.

The `mapContainerRef` is needed to render the map into an HTML element.

Here we added the Mapbox map within a React `useEffect` hook. This ensures that the map will render before React tries to create the element that contains the map. This also takes a set of options:

`container`: This option tells Map JS to render the map inside the specified DOM element. Here, the map expect the receive the `mapContainerRef` .

`style`: This option defines the style the map will use. Here, we added `mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v11`

The `Zoom and Center` options help to determine the map zoom level and center coordinate. Here, we set the zoom level to 9 and the center which receives the longitude and latitude where the map should be center to \[3.361881, 6.672557\].

Note that the coordinate I added here is for **Lagos, Nigeria**. You can change it to your own choice.

Render Map
==========

Now, let us render the map

The `mapContainerRef` specifies the entry point to which the map will be rendered on the page.

The map also needs to be corrected with few styles. Add the following code to your `app.css` file.

Open `App.js` file and paste the below code.

Here, we import our `GenerateMap.js` into `App.js` . This is to render the map.

If youâ€™ve followed the code well, you should be having the below on your browser.

Mapbox Geocoding
================

Now, let us talk about geocoding and how itâ€™s been used in Mapbox.

**Geocoding** is the process of transforming a description of a location â€” such as a pair of coordinates, an address, or a name of a place â€” to a location on the earthâ€™s surface.

The **Mapbox Geocoding API** does two things: _forward geocoding_ and _reverse geocoding_.

Forward geocoding converts location text into geographic coordinates, turning `Ikeja, Lagos` into `3.33333, 6.58333`.

Reverse geocoding turns geographic coordinates into place names, turning `3.33333, 6.58333` into `Ikeja, Lagos`. These location names can vary in specificity, from individual addresses to states and countries that contain the given coordinates.

**_Okay, let us go back to our code._**

You will need to set up Mapbox geocoding to allow it to transform our location. Now, add the following code to `GenerateMap.js` file.

Here, we added the Mapbox geocoding SDK into the React`useCallback` hook. We then passed in `accessToken` option.

Since this tutorial focused on forward geocoding, Weâ€™ve decided to work with the `forwardGeocode` method. This also takes a set of options:

*   The `query` option to receive the location to be converted. When you make a query, you get a _response_, a JSON-formatted document of the most relevant results from your query.
*   The `countries` option takes the array of string of the country code you are trying to find. **ng** is the internet country code for Nigeria.
*   The `limit` option is to limit the search result. Here, we used 2.

Display the new geometry coordinate
===================================

Now that weâ€™ve been able to fetch the forward geocoding address, letâ€™s create an additional `useEffect` hook to call the function. Add the following code:

Here are few things we did:

*   We load the new geometry coordinate `fetchData()` and do a check once thereâ€™s an update.
*   `**new mapboxgl.Marker()**`  creates a marker and using the `setLngLat()` method to set a new coordinate. And we use the `setPopup()` method to create a popup showing the coordinate description whenever the marker is clicked.
*   We wrote a Mapbox GL JS `map.on('load')` function that helps to load the new values and using `map.flyTo()` to re-center the map to our new value whenever thereâ€™s a change to the geometry center.

You may also notice that we created a new `div` element with `marker` className. Now, let us add styling to our marker. In addition to your previous styling, add the following code to your `app.css` file.

Save your work and go back to the browser page. There is a marker with a ripple effect indicating the position of our new location. You can click the marker to view the description.

Finally!!!ðŸ˜Š
============

You have successfully created a React app that uses Mapbox GL JS and Mapbox forward geocoding. If youâ€™ve followed the tutorial to this point, your final result should look like this:
